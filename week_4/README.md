# 📚 Week 4: Dynamic Programming

## ✅ Objectives
- Grasp the fundamental ideas behind **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.
- Learn to **recognize DP patterns** during problem-solving.

---

## 📘 Study Material
- **Main Reference:**  
  📖 *Chapter 7* of the **Competitive Programmer’s Handbook**

> 🔍 Focus on defining DP states clearly, formulating state transitions, and understanding both memoization (top-down) and tabulation (bottom-up) strategies.  
> 🔍 Practice both recursive and iterative approaches to implementing DP solutions.

---

## 🧠 Practice Problems
Tackle all exercises in the **CSES - Dynamic Programming** section.

## 📝 Tips
- Before coding, always clarify:
  - What are the **states**?
  - How do you **transition** between states?
  - What are the **base cases**?
  - Is there room for **space optimization**?

## 📝 Note
- The time complexity of a dynamic programming approach is generally proportional to the **number of unique states** multiplied by the **number of transitions** per state, unless the algorithm includes other computationally intensive operations.
